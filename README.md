Project Title: A Sonnen Battery Activity
The Challenge
The goal was to build an application that efficiently handles and visualizes charging levels of battery within last 24 hours.

This project demonstrates my ability to take a complex problem from concept to a polished, functional solution, focusing on performance, maintainability, and user experience.

Technical Showcase
This application was built to highlight proficiency in the following key areas:

Frontend Framework: Utilizing React, I built a highly responsive and component-based user interface.

State Management: I implemented Context API to manage the application's theme state.

API Integration: The application seamlessly interacts with API to fetch charging analytic data.

Styling & Design: The UI is designed with a modern aesthetic, using Styled Components to ensure a clean and codebase.

Code Quality: I have focused on writing clean, well structured seprating ui , api integration and busniess logic.

Getting Started
To explore the project, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You will need the following tools installed:

Node.js: Ensure you have the latest LTS version.

Git: For cloning the repository.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/minatalaat/sonnen-battery.git](https://github.com/minatalaat/sonnen-battery.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd sonen-battery

Install dependencies:

npm install

Running json-server
json-server --watch db.json

Running the Application
To start the local development server:

npm run dev

The application should now be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:5173.

A Glimpse of the App
Design Decisions & Architectural Choices
Component Structure: The application uses a logical, hierarchical component structure. For example, src/components contains reusable, presentational components, while src/pages holds container components that manage business logic.

Data Flow: I opted for a one-way data flow to ensure predictable state changes.

Performance: I implemented React Query to ensure a caching for data as It will not be changed with 1 hour.

Let's Connect
Thank you for your time in reviewing this project. I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss my work with you further.
